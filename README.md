# Sphinx Theme Builder

<!-- start-elevator-pitch -->

Streamline the Sphinx theme development workflow, by building upon existing
standardised tools.

- simplified packaging experience
- simplified JavaScript tooling setup
- development server, with rebuild-on-save and automagical browser reloading
- consistent repository structure across themes

> This is a fork of `pradyunsg/sphinx-theme-builder`, specifically for allowing the
> circumvention of Node.js environment bootstrapping through `nodeenv`. The
> workflow is identitical, except for defaulting to using the system's Node.js
> installation, which can be overridden by setting the `STB_USE_SYSTEM_NODE`
> environment variable to `0` or `False`.
> 
> The minum system requirements for the system's Node.js environment are
> *v18.19.1* for `node`, and *v9.9.3* for `npm`.
